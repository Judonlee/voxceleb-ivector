# Speaker Verification task in Voxceleb1 dataset
This repository contains simple scripts for a training i-vector speaker recognition system on Voxceleb1[1] dataset using Kaldi. It was modified based on run.sh file on Kaldi/egs/sre10.

# Requirement
* Kaldi Toolkit

# How to use
1. Move all files to {kaldi_root}/egs/sre10 folder
2. Modify dataset directories and parameters in run.sh file to fit in your machine.
3. Run run.sh file

# Result

The 2048 component GMM-UBM and 600-dimensional i-vector extractor were trained using voxceleb1 training data for verification task. Training parameter is almost same compared to sre10 baseline on Kaldi egs.

GMM-2048 CDS eer : 15.39%<br />
GMM-2048 LDA+CDS eer : 8.103%<br />
GMM-2048 PLDA eer : 5.446%<br />

# Note
The Voxceleb1 dataset, a large-scale speaker identification dataset was published in 2017 with speaker embedding baseline[1] and reported i-vector shows 8.8% EER. The i-vector was extracted using 1024 component GMM-UBM, so the EER is fairly worse compared to the result above.
